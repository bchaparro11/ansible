1. UI for Ansible:
    1. Paid -> Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (then Red Hat Ansible Tower)
    2. Free -> Ansible AWX

2. There are some certifications about Ansible in Red Hat Web Page
3. Ways Red Hat acquire money from Ansible company purchase:
    1. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
    2. Ansible Consulting

4. Ansible Documentation:
    1. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html

5. Ansible GitHub:
    1. https://github.com/ansible/ansible

6. Through plugins:
    1. We can update the list of hosts that we have in AWS dyanmically

7. Place where community writes Ansible Roles:"
    1. https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/

8. The files that are created right after the installation of Ansible are located in the directory /etc/ansible. We could find the following files there:
    1. ansible.cfg
    2. hosts
    3. roles -> Here's where's gonna be located the roles dowloaded by https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/

9. I can have two types of commands:

    1. Ad hoc commands:
        1. ansible myservers -m ping

    2. Commands applied to ansible commands:
        1. ansible-playbook sample.yml -> This command is execute into the hosts that are list in "hosts" file

10. There are two installation process:
    1. By pip
    2. By OS directly

11. If I install Ansible using pip the program could not have a configuration file. A way to notice that is executing -> ansible --version. An output-example would be:

    ansible [core 2.17.7]
      config file = None
      configured module search path = ['/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
      ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/ansible
      ansible collection location = /root/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
      executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
      python version = 3.10.12 (main, Nov  6 2024, 20:22:13) [GCC 11.4.0] (/usr/bin/python3)
      jinja version = 3.0.3
      libyaml = True
    
    Through this output we oculd realize that the config file field is equal to None, namely, there's no config file

12. I could create more groupings in the same inventory file

13. Inside the playbook I can reference:
        1. All nodes by the keyword "all" or "*"
        2. One host
        3. Multiple hosts
        4. Groupings
        5. Multiple groups
        6. Excluding logs
        7. Intersection of groups

    I could check more information about in -> https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_patterns.html

14. Examples comparing ad hoc commmands with playbook.yml notation:
    
        Documentation:

            https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/find_module.html#find-module

        Playbook.yml:
            
            - name: Find /var/log all files
              find:
                paths: /var/log
                recurse: no
                file_type: file

        Ad Hoc commmand:
            
            ansible localhost -m find -a "paths=/var/log file_type=file"
  
        Notes:
            
            I could use "ls" instead of a "find module", but in this case the module gave more data

1. I don't have create a [] called all that's going to gather all groups because by defautl Ansible do it
2. Module Index: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/modules_by_category.html
